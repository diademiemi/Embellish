# Embellish

## About
Embellish is a Spigot plugin to generate colour codes for string ingame. This allows players to quickly apply and preview hexadecimal colour codes to signs, their nickname or other things that take hex codes. Embellish is made for servers Minecraft 1.16 and above! Hex code support was only introduced in Minecraft 1.16, so this is required.  
This plugin doesn't handle setting nicknames itself, but you can configure a button which allows players to easily set it from this plugin.
